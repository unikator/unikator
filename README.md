- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @unikator
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in refreshing my development skills. 30 years ago I developed software for the Commodore Amiga, both C/C++ and M68K.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning something new every day.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: In my former life, I was a registered Amiga Developer. Good times :-)!
